# User Docs

## Purpose
This directory is reserved for user-facing documentation (end users, server admins, or external operators).

## Current State
No documents are currently classified as user-facing.

Most existing docs in this repo are internal architecture, contributor workflow, or testing references and now live under `docs/internal/`.

## Placement Rules
Put docs here only if they are intended to be shared outside the core development team without internal implementation context.
