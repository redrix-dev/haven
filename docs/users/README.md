# User Docs

## Purpose
This directory is reserved for user-facing documentation (end users, server admins, or external operators).

## Current State
User-facing docs are intentionally kept short and practical. Internal engineering docs remain under `docs/internal/`.

## Available User Docs
- `docs/users/web-and-mobile-install.md`
  - How to install Haven as a web app/PWA and enable notifications on desktop/mobile
- `docs/users/releases/2026-02-26-web-pwa-notifications-and-reliability-update.md`
  - Draft release notes for the web/PWA + notifications rollout
- `docs/users/releases/2026-02-27-v1.5.0-pwa-rollout.md`
  - Release notes draft for v1.5.0 incremental root-PWA rollout

## Placement Rules
Put docs here only if they are intended to be shared outside the core development team without internal implementation context.
