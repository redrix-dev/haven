# Marked for Deletion (Review Queue)

## Purpose
This folder is a manual review queue, not a trash bin.

Documents here were moved out of active documentation because they appear to be:
- phase-specific snapshots,
- completed refactor checklists,
- one-off analyses, or
- potentially superseded by more durable runbooks/architecture docs.

## Deletion Review Rules
Before deleting a file from this folder, confirm one of the following:
1. The content is fully superseded by an active doc.
2. The content is historical-only and not needed for audits/onboarding.
3. Any still-useful guidance has been extracted into a kept document.

## Current Review Reasons
- `haven-deep-dive-analysis.md`: non-canonical analysis/mentorship snapshot; high staleness risk.
- `type-safety-phase-1.md`: completed phase report; implementation snapshot, not reference doc.
- `type-safety-phase-2.md`: completed phase report; implementation snapshot, not reference doc.
- `renderer-refactor-checklist.md`: temporary execution checklist for a completed refactor.
- `hardening-audit.md`: phase-specific audit snapshot; review for durable findings before deletion.
