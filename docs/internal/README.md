# Internal Documentation Index

## Purpose
Internal architecture references, contributor workflow material, testing runbooks, and review queues.

## Sections
- `architecture/`: system boundaries, feature architecture, and platform behavior references
- `contributor/`: team workflow, onboarding, and AI/contributor guidance
- `operations/`: release/update/operator runbooks
- `testing/`: local test harness and test suite reference material
- `marked-for-deletion/`: documents kept temporarily for manual review before deletion

## Audit and Review
- Document inventory and keep/delete decisions: `docs/internal/document-catalog.md`
- Deletion review rationale: `docs/internal/marked-for-deletion/README.md`

## Important
`docs/internal/` is git-ignored for new files by default. If you intentionally add a new tracked internal document, use `git add -f`.
